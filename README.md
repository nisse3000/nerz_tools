edit_gnuplot_ps.py
Python script that edits a ps/eps file obtained from gnuplot by changing the non-filled box, circle, diamond, and triangle point styles to have a black outline and filled color (given by gnuplot's "lc" option during plotting).  The user has to provide the ps/eps filename as a (command-line) argument.  To do: changing pentagons doesn't work yet.
